# Congratulations on Ruby 25th anniversary!
I started using Ruby about six years ago, so my experience is not so long compared to the history of Ruby. However, my programming life has changed a lot since starting using Ruby.

If I use Ruby's rich standard libraries and magical gems such as Rails, I can develop my program in no time. In addition, it is really fun to write code in Ruby. I've been hearing that "Ruby is fun" for a long time, and it turns out that the rumors are true (it is hard to explain why in a few words, though).

In the Ruby world, it is easy to recognize individuals who write code or share knowledge since everything is open. Because of that, if I look on social media or participate in events, I feel that people using Ruby are connected by an invisible circle of Rubyists that goes beyond any one company or organization, which feels very comfortable to me.

I hope that such nice Ruby communities continue, and I want to contribute to that if there is anything I can do. I really appreciate Mr. Yukihiro Matsumoto, Ruby committers and developers who create useful gems. I hope that Ruby will progress further and more in the future (And I am also looking forward to the coming of Ruby 3!).
